Here are the rules for creating new PHP functions:

Function names must start with a letter or an underscore.
Function names cannot contain spaces.
Function names are not case-sensitive.
Function names cannot be the same as reserved keywords.
Function names should be descriptive and reflect what the function does.
Function arguments are optional, but if you do define arguments, they must be declared in the function definition. Arguments can be passed to functions by value or by reference.

Function bodies can contain any valid PHP code, including other functions. Functions can also return values.
